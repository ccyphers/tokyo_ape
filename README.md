# Tokyo Ape

For user's who enjoy working with mashape's
kong(https://getkong.org) and want a standalone nodejs based API
for integrating with the Admin interface,
without a lot of overhead review the examples to get an idea how you can
use this interface in your project.

This is very early stage code, with a lot of enhancements
needed to include things such as passing on header details from the
caller to the admin instance.  Stay tuned for a demo application using
Tokyo Ape.
